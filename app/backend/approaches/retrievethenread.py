Question: 'How does UCS X series differ from UCS B Series?'

Sources:

Answer:
The Cisco UCS X-Series and UCS B-Series are both modular server platforms from Cisco. However, there are some key differences between the two platforms.

The UCS X-Series is a newer platform that is designed to be more scalable and flexible than the UCS B-Series. The UCS X-Series can be configured with up to 48 compute nodes in a single chassis, while the UCS B-Series is limited to 16 compute nodes per chassis. The UCS X-Series also supports a wider range of processor and memory options than the UCS B-Series.

Another key difference between the two platforms is the way they are managed. The UCS X-Series is managed by the Cisco Intersight management platform, which is a cloud-based platform that provides centralized management and monitoring for all of your Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) devices. The UCS B-Series is managed by the Cisco UCS Manager, which is a local management platform that is installed on each UCS server.

The UCS X-Series is a more expensive platform than the UCS B-Series. However, the UCS X-Series offers a number of advantages, including scalability, flexibility, and centralized management. If you need a high-performance, scalable, and flexible server platform, the UCS X-Series is a good option. If you are looking for a more affordable option, the UCS B-Series is a good choice.
